    Working Features:
        -Scraping indeed.com job postings(getLinks,getDescriptions)
        -extracting skills using coreNLP(NLP)
        -analyizing data using k-mediod clusters(analysis-clustering)
        -analyze data using bag of words(analysis-bar)
        -calculates bhattacharyya coefficient

    Testing:
        Process: in order to test our code we will manually extract the code from the job descriptions. We will then compare this to the skills our code extracted from the descriptions.
         we will also manually examine the data to ensure the clustering is working properly. 
        Test Case:
            data collection:
            skill extraction:
                Description: 
                Our Skills:
